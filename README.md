# 2D-to-3D-Convertor
Flutter application that acts as the UI side of my final year project: 3D Object Reconstruction from 2D Image using Deep Learning. 

The project focused on constructing a 3D model from few (preferably single) 2D images using Deep Learning Algorithms. Check out the API side here: https://github.com/DesignerDenin/2d-to-3d-api/

4. Run the flutter app using
